# mmReIData
mmReIData: Pedestrian re-identification dataset based on mmWave radio frequency signal.

# Short Information
mmReIData is a mmWave signal dataset for person re-identification (Re-ID). The dataset is collected by two COTS Texas Instruments (TI) IWR6843 radar devices from two different days and positions of 41 pedestrians.

Currently, the ‘/images’ folder contains about 30 minutes of Doppler velocity data for five pedestrians. 

The entire 41 volunteers’ RF dataset will be publicly released soon.
