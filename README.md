# About mmReIData
This repo contains the dataset for the paper: mmReID: Person Reidentification Based on Commodity Millimeter-Wave Radar, published in the IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 2025.

# Short Information
mmReIData is a mmWave signal timeâ€“velocity heatmap dataset for person re-identification (Re-ID). The dataset is collected by two COTS Texas Instruments (TI) IWR6843 radar devices from two different days and positions of 41 pedestrians.

The data files were been named with A_B_C_D.png, so that:
1) The character A at the beginning indicates the pedestrian number, from 00 to 40;
2) The character B indicates the different time, such as 0 (the first time), 1 (the second time).
3) The characters C and D indicate the segmentation of data collected each time.
